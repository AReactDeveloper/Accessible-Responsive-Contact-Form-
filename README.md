# Form Validation App

## Overview

This web application provides a form with several input fields and performs client-side validation to ensure the correctness of the data entered. It includes fields for first name, last name, email, and message, along with options for selecting a query type and giving consent. The application validates the inputs, provides user feedback, and displays error messages for invalid or missing data.

## Features

- **Input Validation:** Checks for required fields (first name, last name, message) and validates email format.
- **Radio Button Validation:** Ensures at least one radio button (General Enquiry or Support Request) is selected.
- **Consent Checkbox:** Validates that the consent checkbox is checked.
- **Error Display:** Shows error messages and highlights invalid fields in red.
- **Success Message:** Displays a success message upon successful form submission.
- **Simulated Submission:** Instead of reloading the page, it simulates form submission after displaying the success message.
